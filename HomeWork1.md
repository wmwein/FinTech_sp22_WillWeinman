# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Decentral Games

The data of the genesis block for decentral games as well as the initial token distribution was November 26th 2020. Though the game first released a closed beta in September of 2019.

* Who are the founders of the company?
the companies founders are Miles Anthony and Scitt de Taboada

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
This company was launched in unison with decentraland with the goal of creating a virtual casino owned by the community.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
This company is funded through minting of nfts, the revenue of the casino itself, sales of nfts on the secondary market. The company is also looking to bring advertisers into the casino which will provide additional funding.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The casino business is the definition of having a high barrier of entry. Decentral Games aims to give the power and revenue of casino ownership to their community and changing the requirements for owning a portion of a casino.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
The biggest advantage that decentral games has over their competion is they're first to market. They already have thousands of daily active players logging into their servers in the metaverse and utilizing the play to earn mechanics. This companies is looking for people who are investors looking to make passive income, skilled poker players who are looking for steadier source of income and less risk than playing in real world casinos. Decentral games has 183 thousand monthly metaverse visitors and their are 111 thousand wallets holding DG their governance token.


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Decentral Games is currently only opperating within the decentraland virtual world which is built on the etherum block chain. The issue the ethereum chain is the high gas fees required to preform a transaction so the company recently swithced their opperation onto the polygon side chain. Decentral Games has also partnered with other block chain companies such as Connext in order to allow users to instantaneously swap tokens onto and off of the polygon chain through novel routing architecture. DG also partnered with Transak to manage fiat-to-crypto transactions that patrons within the casino utilize as an atm.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Decentral Games is a company built on the polygon and ethereum block chain.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
over the past year the nft market has exploded and created what some might call a bubble. however what people don't realise is that nfts are a hedge against the crypto market similar to how stocks are a hedge against inflation. The biggest trend right now is companies and block chains trying to figure out how to lower gas costs and create exeriences people actually want to use/visit.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
While there aren't any comparable companies in the domain at the moment, DG is housed within Decentraland that has compatitors of Sand Box, Wilder World, and Roblox.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Last month DG earned $6.5 million dollars in revenue. Decentral Games is responsible for about 50% of all traffic in Decentraland while still in beta. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
The biggest metric companies in the nft space use to measure success if trading volume as well as number of holders. DG is a top company in both of these statistics with the afformentioned 111k wallets holding the governance token and 7.2k ETH volume traded on Open Sea ranking it 55 of all projects on the platform.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Again Decentral Games is the biggest metaverse project currently with it's 10k daily active p2e players. it is the biggest project in decentraland by far and no other virtual universes are even open to the public as of the time of writing.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
As I mentioned earlier Decentral Games has mentioned they are looking into potential advertisers for their game. In my opinon if they are able to secure an advertiser it would bring legitamacy as well as open a massive source of revenue for the company. They have proven they can create and maintain a large active player base now they just need some outside funding in order to keep the momentum going. 


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Selling add space will provide decentral games with an additional source of reveune in order to pay out nft holders as well as fund the company. Requiring advertisers purchase space in $ICE and burning it will also further benefit the players as it will increase the amount they can earn through playing.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
This service would utilize block chain technology that is already in place in order to manage payment for the adds. The advertiser would likely leverage block chain and nft technology in order to create the add and display it within the casino.


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
the virtual universe is built on block chain technology and I can't find a reason DG would deviate from that. using nfts/block chain Could automate the process so companies could essentially bid for the add space on the block chain and at the conclusion of the auction the add formatted as an nft would be automatically displayed for the time period outlined in the smart contract. The advertisers have full transparency as to what their buying and they can have full confidence that they're going to get what they paid for.
